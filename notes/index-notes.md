# Animation Notes

## Neccisary
---
The page is current empty and needs to be filled out with some animations. Most of them just need scroll trigger stuff, as noted in the html code.

## Unneccisary
---
- In the background of the index page, have different animations fade in and out, such as charts of progress, list of reps, or other features in the app
